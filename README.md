# StudyHub project

## Description

This project is a platform for students that combines individual work and team interaction. Each user can have their own space for tasks, as well as join teams where a shared Kanban board and material storage are available. Additionally, the system supports group schedules that can be synchronized with Google Calendar to conveniently track classes or deadlines. Communication is built through notifications: invitations to groups, reminders about deadlines, or confirmations of completed tasks are sent to the application and duplicated in the Telegram bot. To motivate users, a points system has been implemented: completed tasks and praise from other participants bring additional bonuses. This creates an atmosphere of healthy competition and helps to maintain a high level of engagement in the team's work.
